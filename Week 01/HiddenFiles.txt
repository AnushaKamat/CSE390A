How to view "Hidden" aka dot files
-----------------------------------------------------------

This is about a problem you might encounter when trying to turn in
your .plan and .bash_profile files for homework #4.  When you are at a
linux terminal, ls -a allows you to see files that start with
".". However, it is often tricky to see these same files from other
visual file browsers.  This is a problem when you are trying to upload
files into the catalyst dropbox and it uses a visual file browser to
do so...

Windows:

In Windows file explorer, you can select Organize->Folder and Search
Options.  And then select the View Tab, and select "Show hidden files,
folders and dives".

In older versions of windows you can try Tools->Folder Options and then
select the View tab as described above.

Mac:

It looks like there are multiple different ways to see hidden folders on the
Mac.

In the two most recent versions of Mac OS X, for file Open and Save dialog
boxes, type Shift-Command-Period to toggle hidden files between visible and
invisible. That does not work in the Finder (Mac's version of a file
explorer). And you have to type it every time you open the Open and Save
dialog boxes because its not sticky. But assuming that you have upgraded
your OS in the last two years, people should be able to use this feature on
"Open" dialog boxes.

To make all files visible in the Finder by default, run the shell command
"defaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles YES" and then relaunch
the Finder. This should work on all Mac OS X versions, but it doesn't change
the behavior of Open and Save dialogs, at least not in the most recent
version of the OS.

Let me know if you have any questions, or if current Mac users have
any more info to add.
