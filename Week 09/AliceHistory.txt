# Sample commands for Alice, # means a comment, not a parameter to svn

# 8am - Make the repo: Alice or Bob or someone else could have done this.
cd 390
mkdir lec09-repo
svnadmin create lec09-repo/
chgrp -R cse390a lec09-repo/
chmod -R g+rwX,o-rwx lec09-repo/

# 9am - Create a working directory for Alice
mkdir aliceDir
cd aliceDir

# Get a copy of the current repo (currently just an empty folder)
# Since the repo is on attu and we are on attu use file://foldername
# if elsewhere we would use svn+ssh://attu.cs.washington.edu/foldername
svn co file:///homes/iws/rea/390/lec09-repo
cd lec09-repo/

# 10am - Create a file and add and commit it to the repo
emacs silly.txt
svn add silly.txt # Don't forget to "add" new files to the repo before commiting
svn status	  # Shows that silly.txt is scheduled to be (A)dded
svn ci silly.txt -m "Added a silly file"

# 11am - Makes a change to silly.txt, does not check it in yet...
emacs silly.txt 
svn status 	# Shows that Alice's copy of silly.txt has been (M)odified.
svn diff silly.txt # Shows diffs between local modifications Alice made to 
    		   # what she originally checked out as her working copy.

# 1pm - Finally checks in modified silly.txt
svn ci -m "very silly text added"
