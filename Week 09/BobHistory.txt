# Sample commands for Bob, # means a comment, not a parameter to svn

# 11am - Create a working directory for Bob
mkdir bobDir
cd bobDir/

# 11am - Checkout files from the repo for Bob, gets a copy of orig silly.txt
svn co file:///homes/iws/rea/390/lec09-repo/
ls
cd lec09-repo
ls -la

# 12:30pm - Bob is ready to start working, updates his copy of the repo
svn update  	# Alice has not checked in her changes yet, Bob won't see them
svn log silly.txt # shows a history of the check in messages that involved
    		  # a change to silly.txt (can also call svn log to see 
		  # log of all changes to the repo)
emacs silly.txt

# 2pm - Bob is done working on his copy of silly.txt, tries to check in. 
svn ci silly.txt -m "complimented Alice on her silly text"

# Checking in did not work due to conflict...

# Updating warns of the problem, Bob selects "p" to postpone 
svn update

# Postponing creates 3 new file versions and adds in markers 
# to the silly.txt file.
ls -la
more silly.txt		# Version with "markers" showing conflicts
more silly.txt.mine 	# The version Bob just tried to check in.
more silly.txt.r1 	# The verson Bob checked out (without his edits).
more silly.txt.r2 	# The version Alice just checked in.

# Bob chooses to edit the silly.txt file directly to remove the markers
# and incorporate both his and Alice's modifications.
emacs silly.txt

# Tells svn to get rid of all those other versions other than silly.txt
svn resolve --accept=working silly.txt

# 3pm - Bob checks in the fixed version of silly.txt
svn ci silly.txt -m "complimented Alice on her silly text"

# Bob is just curious to confirm that other versions of silly.txt are gone.
ls -la
svn log silly.txt 
svn status
